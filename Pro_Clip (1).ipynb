This product is lightweight and provides hydration without clogging pores, which is ideal for oily skin. It contains aloe water and hyaluronic acid, which help to hydrate the skin while maintaining a fresh feel.\\n\\nHowever, since the skin of children can be more sensitive, it's always best to consult with a pediatric dermatologist before introducing any new skincare products.
